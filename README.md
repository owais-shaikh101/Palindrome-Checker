## ðŸ“– Project Description

**Palindrome Checker** is a simple and interactive web application that allows users to determine whether a given word, phrase, or sentence is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spaces.

Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the interface offers a clean and responsive design with instant feedback upon submission. The tool processes input in real-time, sanitizing the text by removing all non-alphanumeric characters and converting it to lowercase before performing the palindrome check.

This project is ideal for beginners in web development looking to understand DOM manipulation, string handling, and basic validation using vanilla JavaScript.
